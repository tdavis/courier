Courier â€” Delivery Drones For Your SOA
======================================

Courier is a reliable, high-performance, transactional, multi-protocol
message brokering appliance.

In traditional terms, Courier can best be described as a combination
of *Task Queue* and *Pub/Sub* in a single system. It combines the
*robustness* and *flexibility* of task queues with the *ease of use*
and *efficiency* of Pub/Sub.

Furthermore, while traditional solutions often introduce their own
unique, incompatible wire protocols, Courier uses HTTP and WebSockets,
both very common and compatible TCP-based protocols.
